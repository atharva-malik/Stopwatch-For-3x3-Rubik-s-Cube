# Stopwatch-For-3x3-Rubik's-Cube
## 3x3 Rubik's Cube Scrambles and Stopwatch
This program is a simple and easy to use script with features like random scrambles and quick start stopwatch with no inspection time. It is fully functional and ready to use.

## Requirements
This script was written entirely in [Python 3.10.1] but should work with every [Python 3.x] release (you might also want a Rubik's Cube).

## Installation and Usage

Install the repository and you are good to go!

Usage guidelines are as follows:
1. As soon as you run the script, it will give you a scramble of a length between 20-25 moves.
2. Follow the scramble displayed with the Green face facing you and the White face facing upwards.
3. The stopwatch will start as soon as you press [enter] __or__ [return].
4. To stop the stopwatch simply press [enter] __or__ [return] again. Your time and the next scramble will be displayed.
5. To exit out, press [e] and [enter] __or__ [return].
